I have participated in the interview process both in China and U.S, mainly for programmers, internship students, but also research colleagues. I am not the interviewer who has the last word, just the boss is usually too busy. I needed to arrange the interview, collect information, and ‘establish’ an opinion. Then the boss appeared, talked with the visitor about five to ten minutes, and finally discussed the finalists with me.  So this article is not a professional opinion but just my personal thoughts.

If we think of an interview as a project, one way to evaluate the goal is "efficiency", i.e. did we do a good job collecting accurate information, understanding the visitor’s situation, and make the right decision. The other way is "experience", i.e. whether we finished on pleasant terms with each other, not in embarrassment and uncomfortable.  Although we have a few of different goals, the purpose of the procedure is to solve the following three questions:

1. Can the person get the job done?
1. Will he/she get along well with the team?
1. What is the ‘cost’ to do #1 and #2 if I am the person to help him/ her get involved?

"Can the person get the job done?" For an interviewer with technical background, it is easy to have unrealistic expectations.  For example, my first time interviewing someone went exactly how I just described; it happened almost 12 years ago when my group needed an intern. I was asked to participate as a technical interviewer. I was only twenty-five and was very excited. I immediately prepared THREE groups of questions list: the first one contained basic, common questions; then followed by in-depth ones; and then I even listed out some questions I don’t have satisfying answers to. Of course, it turned out to be a very tough test. When it was finished, my colleague told me the questions were too hard. That was true. I had to admit that if I were the interviewee,  even I could not pass that kind of test.  It was entirely for the interviewer, rather than for the candidates, and simply did not achieve the purpose.

"Is this person able to work on the team?" This is an evaluation of how the candidate can get along with the co-workers.  In the process of the interview,  the candidate is just speaking and expressing himself/ herself. You need to tell how he/ she will perform/act in reality. Bias will be there. But you can always get some information for reference if you can find good questions. For example, you can provide some information and check the quality of his response. Would the candidate provide some relevant information with clarity, or just some general stuff which is hard to tell whether it is useful or not?

"What is the ‘cost’?” This means we want to do a more accurate assessment. Everything comes at a cost: time, money, opportunity management. If it is too hard to coordinate work with somebody, you can not even protect yourself. Also, you need to think about how to work with this candidate: can he work independently from scratch, or need more guidance and instruction? Again, everything comes at a cost.

And the rest are ‘HR questions’: long-term plan, honesty, productivity, etc. This relies on you having a lot of experience with reading people, which I don’t have.

And the next is the interview process.  In China it used to be like this:

1. Interviewers holding the resume of candidate, asking him to start his self-introduction, or the candidate having the opportunity to present a 15-minutes slide show;
1. Question and answer; in the end the interviewee gets the turn to ask his questions;
1. Coding/operating on a computer;
1. HR people come to help the candidate to fill some psychological questionnaire;

I did not have too much influence to this procedure when I was in China, in other words, I was regarded as "technical support" for HR department. In my opinion, this process is also, from the perspective of the recruiter, easy to operate. However, I don’t think people’s abilities can be evaluated fairly through such processes. I would like to start in a more relaxed atmosphere to get the natural and real aspects of the candidates beyond the resumes and emails.  If it takes me 20 minutes but I still can’t get deeper than the surface impression, I will question the communication between the candidates and myself. I will consider it is the failure of my job, not candidates’. 

A resume represents the candidate’s ‘self-vision’ and the efforts to take a chance. My job is not to investigate where his/ her experience statement is ‘reliable’ or ‘credible,' but to answer a series of my questions:  did the candidate achieve something on their own, or were they just a ‘free rider’ in a group? Does he/ she stick to specific details and try to integrate them into a bigger picture?  Does the person have the responsibility to make sure he/ she conveys useful things to other people? These are really important questions rather than some ‘exaggerated highlight’ in the resume. In fact, technical ability and project experience can be very easily verified nowadays. I won’t ask a person a python/R question to test whether he really can remember a command or function. I just encourage the candidate to evaluate himself/ herself: how do you describe your level of X language/tools. Then, open your GitHub page, do some brief introduction or presentation. Almost everything you have done and are doing is traced by technology. 

A distinction exists between “surface" knowledge and"essence" knowledge; it depends on the time you invest on the understanding of the important concepts.  Your understanding can be different from mine in a good way, but not just by listing out some popular vocabulary. If you never heard of some specific term, it is totally fine. But don’t give me specious, plausible inputs. Don’t leave me an impression that you don’t care too much about what you just said. If you learn a lot of things, experience a lot of projects, but you don’t care too much about the consistency within your own knowledge, it will be a really bad thing. It probably means that when you move to new stuff, your abilities to transfer from ‘theory’ into ‘action’ would be very weak. You seem to be ‘fast learner’ but will end as an ‘aimless talker.'

I ask people to talk about themselves, just occasionally intervening for different purposes.  Sometimes I express consent and encouragement, and sometimes  confirm his/ her level of practice. Sometimes I explore the depth and breadth of their knowledge.  In this process, every word he/ she speaks is to provide testimony for his/ her actual communication skills.

In the Internet age seeking the answer to a well-defined question is already resolved (maybe not for some people), so the question should be how to manage and get the insights from so much information. I am always wondering why people still hesitate to introduce some revolutionary changes in the forms of the interview?

In fact, the higher level the job seeker is, the richer experience he/ she has, and the more he/ she will tend to use a social network to find the next job.  In this process, all exchange of information is often through a talk over dinner, since it can make people more relaxed and more efficient in exchanging crucial information. So why not do the same things in the interview?  As the interviewer, it requires a sense of consciousness. You are the person to start such a of conversation, so you have the responsibility to make this process smoother and everyone's mood more comfortable. The candidate will not necessarily meet all your expectations; he/ she just needs to answer your questions fairly to help you determine whether it is worth spending more time on him/ her or not. I treat each interviewee in good faith, and they spend their own time to enrich my knowledge.  I am also trying my best to provide them with useful information as a reference.

For the interviewee, I think you should be fair to yourself first: if you feel you didn’t perform as expected, maybe it is not your fault, maybe you just met a not-so-good interviewer, who does not know their duties quite well and doesn’t realize his/ her responsibility to guide you to perform. But if you can tell the interviewer is friendly, you should take the opportunity to start an effective communication to make the most of this experience.
